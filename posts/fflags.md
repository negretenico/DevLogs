# Feature Flags: Controlling Behavior in Production

Feature flags are a software design pattern that lets you turn features on or off without redeploying code. They act like light switches inside your application, giving you control over what users see.

## Why Use Feature Flags?

1. **Safe Releases**: Ship code dark and enable features gradually  
2. **Experimentation**: Run A/B tests without complicated deployments  
3. **Operational Control**: Quickly disable faulty features in production  
4. **Customization**: Offer different features to different groups of users  

With proper tooling, feature flags become an essential part of modern development workflows.
