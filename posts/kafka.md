# Introduction to Kafka for Real-Time Systems

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to handle high-throughput, real-time data pipelines. Think of it as a central nervous system for your applications, where data constantly flows between different parts of the system.

## Key Concepts

1. **Producers**: Send messages into Kafka topics  
2. **Topics**: Act as categories or feeds for events  
3. **Consumers**: Subscribe to topics and process events  
4. **Brokers**: Kafka servers that store and replicate messages  

By combining these parts, Kafka ensures data can be streamed, replayed, and processed with strong durability and scalability.
